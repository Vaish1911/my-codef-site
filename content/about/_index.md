Hi! I am an undergraduate student studying Biomedical Sciences at UCL. I have just finished first year a few months ago, so I still remember how daunting the transition from sixth form to university was. Though I cannot turn back time and help myself in the past, I can help many others avoid any mistakes I have made over the past year.
