### What is next? 

Sixth form is a short but critical period in your education, where everything you do leads up to your offer from university. This can make the process of starting university daunting, so here are some helpful tips and advice that may ease the anxiety. 

This page will cover: 

- Moving out

- Budgeting 

### Moving Out 

When you have spent most of your life at home with family, moving out can be a fantastic way to gain independence and learn to live your life as an adult.

It will be hard and it is challenging, but definetly something that all university students recommend, if it is possible, do it! 

Here are some things I have learnt in my first year moving out: 

- _It can get lonely_

Something no one will ever tell you about university is the amount of time you will have to spend on your own in your room during term time. 

To overcome this, I recommend finding a new hobby or a location outside of your room, this can be a cafe or a local park, where you can spend time with friends or eve by yourself! 

> Learning to be comfortable in your own company is part of adulthood! 

- _Meal prep! Meal prep!_

One thing I loved about living out was having the freedom to eat whatever I want, whenever I want. 

However, I quickly realised the problems that come with that habit - wasting money on take away. To avoid this, plan a day in your week to do your groceries and prepare meals for the coming week. Saves you money and is always healthier than fast food!

- _Go out_

Living out in a new city come with a lot of advantages, one of them being having access to famous landmarks, museums and parks. If you are in London most things are a walk or a bus away!

Plan days out with friends on your course or in your accommodation to go and explore the city, this will help you shift your attention from the workload and will also benefit your mental health. 

### Budgeting 

Money, money, money! Moving out definetly has its perks, however, one of the biggest challenge is using your money wisely. 

Things your weekly budget should take into account: 

- Food
- Going out 
- Bills (phone bills etc)
- Travel 
- Rent 
- Income from parents and/or student finance, part-time jobs

Estimate an annual income from student finace including any other incomes and calculate how much you can comfortably spend each week after paying rent for the term.
