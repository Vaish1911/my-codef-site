## No mark schemes?

This was probably the biggest change from A-levels to university - some universities do not provide mark schemes at all! 

This may sound terrifying but there is a good reason why. Sixth form teaches you how to get the best grade possible, this why they use revision methods based on wrote learning, where you memorise phrases and wording that gets you the marks. 

__University is different!__ 

At university, you are doing a subject you are interested in (I hope), so they want to know how you think, not just if you can remember phrases. Don't be mistaken, you still have to memorise a lot, but your understanding is completely upto how you interpret what you learn in lectures and the extra reading you do ... so no mark schemes!

#### If there are no mark schemes, how do we revise? 

Of course there are many preferences to revision, but here I have compiled some of my favourite tips and tricks to get the high 2:1 to 1st: 

1. **Study groups**

Probably the only thing that kept me going through exam season was arranging a productive, reliable and most importantly motivated study group with a few friends on my course. 

This will become extremely useful when you have practise papers with no model answers, you can either do the paper as a group discussion or even individually and peer assess. You become well versed in your subject but also develop your communication skills. 

- _How do I go about making a study group?_

Very simple! Join a whatsapp group chat, most university courses and societies have group chat links available on their instagram or facebook. 

Suggest doing weekly study zoom calls and you can start to see familiar faces but also likeminded people to you! This allows you to have academic dicussion but also vent any concerns you have. You will find that most often if you are stressed or having trouble, you are not alone! 

2. __Blurting!__ 

Sounds strange, but this technique is the best way to find any holes in your knowledge.

I find this technique to be helpful just after I do any reading or when I finish watching a lecture. Blurting mind maps are the way to go.
