Career - it is a big word, but the sooner you start thinking about it, the better you will be in the long run!

*How can I find out what I am interested in?* 

- **Career's fairs** 

Universities will host plenty of career fairs and my best advice is: try and attend as much as you can. Worst case scenario: you do not see yourself in that career, at least you can rule things out and narrow down your options! 

You will be suprised as to how many different industries and services there are to offer - you will be suprised by how little you know. 

- __Networking__

A useful life skill you will pick up from attending these career fairs is networking! 

> "It is not what you know but who you know"

Never underestimate the power of networking as it massively aids the progression of your career and gives you an insider prespective of the industry you are interested in. 

Networking can be done through various ways but the easiest way I have found is LinkedIn! Perhaps there is a company that offers an internship for a role that you are interested in, do some research before applying and filter for any alumni from your university who currently work at the company. Introduce yourself to them via LinkedIn and ask questions to gain an insight into the company's values. 

Here is an example of how you can approach them:

From my experience, most profressionals are kind and welcoming, usually are more than happy to arrange zoom calls to discuss about their experience within the company and this is how you can build strong networks! 

- **Keep an eye out**

Many companies run networking and insight events however it is very difficult to keep up with deadlines and dates. 

That is why services such as SEO London and Bright Network are extremely useful platforms which remind you of opportunities tailored to your interest.
